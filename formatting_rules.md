## Key Differences Summary

### Header/Identification
**Memorandum:**
- Letterhead with DoD seal
- Office symbol 2 lines below seal
- "MEMORANDUM FOR" addressee line
- Date on same line as office symbol (flush right)

**OPORD:**
- Keywords identify type: FRAGO, WARNO, OPORD
- Top-right header block with: copy count, unit info, address, date
- Classification markings at top (CUI, U, etc.)
- No office symbol or addressee line
- Additional header elements: References, Time Zone, Task Organization

### Subject Line
**Memorandum:** "SUBJECT:" in uppercase, followed by subject text
**OPORD:** Name of order (e.g., "OPORD 24-001"), aligned left, one line below date

### Closing/Signature
**Memorandum:**
- Authority line (2nd line below text, left margin, uppercase)
- Signature block 5th line below authority line, centered

**OPORD:**
- No authority line
- "OFFICIAL:" with bold underline two spaces below
- Signature block 5th line **above** "OFFICIAL:" line, centered

### Paragraph Formatting
**Both use same hierarchy** - no paragraph or sentence length limits for either document type

### Multi-Page Documents
**Memorandum:** Continuation pages have office symbol + subject at top
**OPORD:** No office symbol; text continues directly below classification markings

---

## Additional Rules from Letter Formatting (Applied to Memorandum per User Request)

| Rule Category | Memorandum (from Letter Rules) |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| **Continuation Pages** | For multi-page documents: minimum 2 lines on continuation page; center page number with hyphens on each side (- 2 -); start text 5th line below page number (4 line breaks) |
| **Point of Contact Details** | May include name, commercial phone, fax, email; usually in last paragraph |
| **Subparagraphs (if used)** | Use letters (a, b, c, d) for subparagraphs; max 4 subparagraphs; if only one, use hyphen (-) to indicate |
| **Enclosure Notes** | Do not use "as stated" or "as." abbreviation; fully identify enclosures in text |

---

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Document Type Detection/Selection
- **User selects document type**: Memorandum, OPORD, FRAGO, WARNO
- **Auto-detect on upload**: Parse for keywords (OPORD, FRAGO, WARNO) and header structure

### 2. Apply Document-Specific Rules
**Common rules (both types):**
- Margins (1" all sides)
- Font (12pt, Arial recommended)
- Spacing (single text, double between paragraphs)
- Paragraph hierarchy (1. → a. → (1) → (a), with suppressChildIndent for levels 4-7)
- Enclosure handling
- Distribution formatting
- Optional crest: 0.5" from top, 0.5" from left edge

**Memorandum-specific:**
- Letterhead at 1" from top
- Crest (if present): 0.5" from top, 0.5" from left
- Office symbol (with ARIMS): 1 line break below crest, flush left; date flush right on same line
- "MEMORANDUM FOR" or "MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD": 2 line breaks below office symbol
- "SUBJECT:": 1 line break below MEMORANDUM FOR line
- Body: 2 line breaks below subject
- Authority line above signature block
- Continuation pages: office symbol + subject header

**OPORD-specific:**
- OPORD letterhead at 1" from top, flush right (Copy/Unit/Address/Date)
- Optional crest (if added): 0.5" from top, 0.5" from left
- Document name (e.g., "WARNO 1 to OPORD 26-01"): 1 line break below letterhead, flush left
- References: 1 line break below document name, numbered list indented 0.25" (levels 1,2,3 only)
- Time Zone: 1 line break below last reference line
- Task Organization: 1 line break below Time Zone
- Body ("1. Situation"): 1 line break below Task Organization
- "OFFICIAL:" line with signature underline
- Continuation pages: classification markings only, no office symbol

### 3. Export Validation
- Check document type
- Apply type-specific CSS/formatting
- Validate required elements present:
  - **Memo**: Office symbol, MEMORANDUM FOR, SUBJECT, authority line
  - **OPORD**: Header block, classification, order name, OFFICIAL line

### 4. UI Components Needed
- **Document Type Selector** (dropdown: Memo, OPORD, FRAGO, WARNO)
- **Conditional Header Renderer**:
  - Memo: Letterhead + office symbol input
  - OPORD: Top-right header block (copy count, unit, address, date inputs)
- **Classification Marking Toggle** (OPORD only)
- **Subject vs. Order Name Field** (conditional based on type)
- **Authority Line vs. OFFICIAL Block** (conditional in closing)

## Rule Categorization & Implementation Approach

**Category Definitions:**
1. **Identification Indicator** - Features/patterns that help determine document type (auto-detection)
2. **General Rule** - Applies to ALL document types; auto-enforced
3. **Document-Specific Rule** - Required for specific document type; conditionally rendered
4. **Additional Option** - User-selectable feature available for any document type (may show warnings if unconventional)

| Rule Name | Category Type | Implementation Approach |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|
| **PAPER & MARGINS** | | |
| Paper size | General Rule | Auto-apply to all documents on export. Set CSS `@page { size: letter; }` for PDF generation. No user interaction needed. |
| Left margin | General Rule | Auto-apply to all documents. Set CSS `margin-left: 1in;` on export. Editor canvas shows 1" left guideline for visual reference. |
| Right margin | General Rule | Auto-apply to all documents. Set CSS `margin-right: 1in; text-align: left;` on export. Disable text justification buttons in editor toolbar. |
| Bottom margin | General Rule | Auto-apply to all documents. Set CSS `margin-bottom: 1in;` on export. Editor shows page break preview at appropriate height. |
| Top margin (first page) | General Rule | Auto-calculate based on letterhead height. Letterhead component measures itself and sets appropriate top margin. First page has dynamic top margin; continuation pages have 1" fixed. |
| **FONT & TYPOGRAPHY** | | |
| Font selection | Additional Option | Provide font dropdown with common choices (Arial 12pt default). Allow user to change font/size. Apply selected font on export. Limit to professional fonts (Arial, Times New Roman, Calibri) to prevent unusual styles. |
| Font style restrictions | General Rule | Enforce by limiting font dropdown to standard professional fonts only. Remove decorative/script fonts from options entirely. |
| Ink color (printing) | General Rule | Auto-apply on export. Set CSS `color: #000000;` for all text. No user override needed. |
| Ink color (signatures) | General Rule | Not enforced digitally. Print instruction only. Add tooltip/help text: "Sign printed document with blue or black ink." |
| **SPACING & PUNCTUATION** | | |
| Text spacing | General Rule | Auto-apply on export. Set CSS `line-height: 1;` for text within paragraphs, `margin-bottom: 1em;` between MilitaryParagraph nodes. MilitaryParagraph component handles spacing automatically. |
| After periods/question marks | General Rule | Optional auto-formatting on export. Run regex replace to normalize to two spaces. Provide toggle: "Auto-format spacing (2 spaces after periods)" in export settings. |
| After commas/colons/semicolons | General Rule | Optional auto-formatting on export. Normalize comma/colon/semicolon spacing to single space. Include in same toggle as period spacing. |
| One-paragraph documents | General Rule | Auto-apply. No special handling needed; single spacing is default. No user interaction required. |
| **LETTERHEAD & HEADER ELEMENTS** | | |
| Document identification | Identification Indicator | **Auto-detect**: Parse uploaded document for keywords (OPORD, FRAGO, WARNO) in subject/header area. Presence of DoD seal image suggests Memo. **Manual**: Document type dropdown at top of editor. Detection helps pre-select type but user can override. |
| Header format | Document-Specific Rule | Conditional header component. **Memo**: Render `<LetterheadMemo />` with DoD seal + office symbol. **OPORD**: Render `<HeaderOPORD />` with flush-right block (copy count, unit, address, date fields). Component switches based on `documentType` state. |
| Classification markings | Additional Option | **Add Classification** button in toolbar (available for all docs). **Memo**: Shows warning "Classification optional for memorandums—typically used for sensitive correspondence only." **OPORD**: Auto-enabled by default with (U) preset. Dropdown: (U), (CUI), (S), (TS). |
| Additional header elements (OPORD) | Document-Specific Rule | **OPORD only**: After header block, render input fields for "References:", "Time Zone:", "Task Organization:" before body text. **Memo**: Not shown. Conditional rendering based on `documentType === 'OPORD'`. |
| Continuing pages | General Rule | No special handling. Continuation pages inherit document styling without header elements (handled separately below). Editor shows page break preview. |
| Office symbol placement | Document-Specific Rule | **Memo**: Text input "Office Symbol" in header component, positioned 2 lines below DoD seal, left-aligned. **OPORD**: Input hidden/not rendered. Conditional based on document type. |
| ARIMS record number | Additional Option | **Memo**: Optional field "ARIMS #" appended to office symbol as `{officeSymbol} ({arims})`. **OPORD**: Same format if user adds office symbol (with warning). Field appears when office symbol is present. |
| Date placement | Document-Specific Rule | **Memo**: Date input flush right, same line as office symbol. **OPORD**: Date input within top-right header block, below address line. CSS positioning differs by document type. |
| Date format | Document-Specific Rule | Date picker component. **Memo**: Format selector (full/abbreviated). **OPORD**: Full format only, no selector. Auto-format on selection. Store as ISO, display per document type rules. |
| **ADDRESSEE SECTION** | | |
| Addressee line ("MEMORANDUM FOR") | Identification Indicator | **Strong identifier**: Presence of "MEMORANDUM FOR" indicates Memo type. **Auto-detect**: Parse for "MEMORANDUM FOR" string. If found, suggest Memo type. **Manual**: Memo header component includes "MEMORANDUM FOR" label + addressee input field. OPORD hides this field. |
| Single address format | Document-Specific Rule | **Memo**: Addressee input field. If short (<60 chars), display on same line as "MEMORANDUM FOR". Auto-detect length and apply inline vs. multiline formatting. |
| Multiple addresses (2-5) | Document-Specific Rule | **Memo**: If addressee field wraps, auto-indent continuation line by 0.25". CSS: `text-indent: -0.25in; padding-left: 0.25in;` for hanging indent effect. |
| Many addresses (5+) | General Rule | **All docs**: Provide "SEE DISTRIBUTION" checkbox. When checked, addressee field shows "SEE DISTRIBUTION" and distribution list appears at bottom of document. Applies to both Memo and OPORD distribution sections. |
| Address capitalization | General Rule | **All docs**: Provide capitalization toggle (UPPERCASE / Title Case). Apply selected style to all address fields consistently. Default: UPPERCASE for military convention. |
| **SUBJECT LINE** | | |
| Subject placement | Document-Specific Rule | **Memo**: Subject positioned 2 lines below addressee field. **OPORD**: Subject (order name) positioned 1 line below date in header block. CSS margin-top differs by document type. |
| Subject format | Identification Indicator | **Strong identifier**: Format distinguishes docs. **Memo**: Prepend "SUBJECT:" label to input field. **OPORD**: No label, input placeholder: "e.g., OPORD 24-001". **Auto-detect**: If subject starts with OPORD/FRAGO/WARNO, suggest OPORD type. |
| Subject length | General Rule | **All docs**: Show word count below subject input. If >10 words, display soft warning: "Consider shortening (currently {count} words)". Does not block—user can proceed. |
| Subject continuation | General Rule | **All docs**: If subject wraps, continuation line flush left. No indent. CSS: `text-align: left;` with no special indentation. |
| Abbreviations in subject | General Rule | **All docs**: Tooltip on subject field: "Avoid abbreviations; use only commonly recognized acronyms (DA, DoD, FY, HQDA)." No enforcement—guidance only. |
| **BODY/TEXT FORMATTING** | | |
| Body start position | General Rule | **All docs**: Auto-position body text 3 lines below subject. CSS handles margin-top spacing. |
| References placement | General Rule | **All docs**: Guidance/tooltip: "List references in first paragraph." No enforcement. User organizes content. |
| Purpose sentence | General Rule | **All docs**: Guidance/tooltip: "Begin with short, clear purpose sentence (BLUF—Bottom Line Up Front)." No enforcement. |
