# ✅ Clerk Authentication - Implementation Complete

## What Was Just Completed

Task 2 (Integrate Clerk authentication) is now **IN PROGRESS** with 6/7 subtasks complete!

### ✅ Completed Subtasks:

1. **✅ Install @clerk/nextjs package** - Package installed and ready
2. **✅ Create middleware.ts** - Route protection configured
3. **✅ Update app/layout.tsx** - ClerkProvider wrapping app with auth UI in header
4. **✅ Create sign-in page** - `/sign-in` route with Clerk SignIn component
5. **✅ Create sign-up page** - `/sign-up` route with Clerk SignUp component
6. **✅ Update home page** - Shows different CTAs for authenticated/unauthenticated users

### ⚠️ Remaining Subtask:

7. **⏳ Configure .env.local** - YOU need to add your Clerk API keys

---

## 🔐 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Get Your Clerk API Keys

1. Go to: **https://dashboard.clerk.com/**
2. Sign in (or create account)
3. Create a new application (or select existing)
4. Go to: **API Keys** (in left sidebar)
5. Copy both keys:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (starts with `pk_test_`)
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` (starts with `sk_test_`)

### Step 2: Create .env.local File

Create a file named `.env.local` in the **root directory** (same level as `package.json`):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_actual_key_here
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys from Clerk!

### Step 3: Test Authentication

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit: **http://localhost:3000**

**Expected behavior:**
- ✅ Header shows "Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons (when not logged in)
- ✅ Clicking "Sign Up" opens authentication modal
- ✅ After signing up, header shows UserButton (profile picture)
- ✅ Clicking UserButton shows "Sign Out" option

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### Option 1: Test Clerk Authentication (Recommended)
1. Create `.env.local` with your Clerk keys (see above)
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Test sign-up, sign-in, sign-out functionality
4. Verify everything works before moving to next task

### Option 2: Continue Development (Auth later)
If you don't have Clerk keys yet, you can continue with other tasks:
- **Task 4:** Create MilitaryParagraph custom node (no auth required)
- **Task 8:** Create three-panel layout (no auth required)
- **Task 9:** Set up IndexedDB (no auth required)

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (5 minutes):
1. **Get Clerk keys** from dashboard.clerk.com
2. **Create .env.local** with your keys
3. **Test authentication** - sign up, sign in, sign out

Install remaining packages:
```bash
npm install dexie zustand mammoth pdfjs-dist jspdf
```

### Then Choose Your Path:
